							Our Mission
						</p>
						<p class="style3" style="color: #676c7a;">
							BSA is a student-run organization that is focused on creating a community and providing opportunities for marginalized 
							students interested in engineering, aerospace-related industries, and aviation.
							
							<br><br>
							
							Founded in 2020, we aim to create an academic and social community among those already pursuing a space-related education at UM, as well as to foster participation in the 
							industry for interested outsiders. We are accepting of everyone, and have quite a few members in disciplines outside of Aerospace 
							and even engineering in general!

							<br><br>
							
							We committed to uplifting current Black Aerospace students, 
							as well as spotlighting the Black Aerospace professionals who have made it in the industry and serve as an inspiration to 
							those coming after them.

							<br><br>

							From our inception in February 2020, BSA has put on events that speak to the accomplishments of Black engineers and scientists. 
							We have also organized virtual panel discussions for members of the College of Engineering, featuring the voices and experiences 
							of Black students, professors, and alumni. BSA strives to initiate and facilitate positive dialogue between Black students and 
							the UM Aerospace Department, and we now work in conjunction with the College of Engineering’s Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (DEI) 
							committee to address issues that Black Aerospace students face at UM.

							<br><br>

							BSA works hard to ensure that Black students feel empowered and confident in their pursuit of an education in the aerospace industry. 
							Students of all majors are welcome to help us bring our vision to life!
