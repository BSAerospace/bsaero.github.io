									<h2>He/Him</h2>
									<p>Although he is not an actual prince, Prince has served BSA very well as a co-founder, and as our first Aerospace Department Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
										(DEI) Committee Liaison. He completed his bachelor's and master's degrees in Aerospace Engineering here at the University of Michigan, focusing on flight 
										dynamics and controls. Through his work in the Michigan eXploration Lab (MXL), Prince has worked on two CubeSats that have been launched into Low Earth Orbit.
										Prince is now a PhD candidate of the Robotics Department, where he has worked on projects that use groups of drones to carry heavy objects and detect wildfires 
										in the western United States. His dissertation work focuses on using locally-generated magnetic field maps to improve navigation capabilities in GPS-denied 
										environments (e.g. inside buildings). With this work, Prince hopes to enable better indoor navigation for low-cost applications. Prince is expected to defend 
										his dissertation in the Fall of 2022 before working in industry as a perception and controls engineer. In his free time, Prince likes to play volleyball and board games.</p>

									<h3>Co-Treasurer</h3>
									<h3><u><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-hersey-bbb8661b3/">Eric Hersey</a></u></h3>
									<h2>He/Him</h2>
									<p>Eric graduated magna cum laude in April 2022 with a BSE in Aerospace Engineering. He served as BSA's first Treasurer, and will continue to do so this upcoming year as he 
										lends his expertise to our incoming Co-Treasurers. He is also involved in Minorities in Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Related Sciences (MANRRS), as well as with the
										 National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE). In his time at UMich, Eric has interned as a Software Engineer for Rockwell Automation, and was a two-time Aerospace Engineering
										  Intern for GE Aviation. He has also worked with an on-campus research group to study spherical bubble dynamics in non-Newtonian biological tissues. During Summer 2022, Eric 
										  will be a Quality Systems Engineer Intern with Lockheed Martin. He will return to UMich in Fall 2022 to further his education with a master’s degree in Aerospace Engineering.
										Outside of class, Eric enjoys culinary artistry and spending time with his friends. He recently made a beef stew with only ingredients from the school’s free pantry. Blending free 
										goods with exciting spices, he self-admittedly is blazing a new path for students interested in cooking while maintaining a livable budget amidst student loans, rent, and book 
										fees. Eric is currently training to compete in a cook-off with professional staff at UMich’s Campus Farm and continues to push his limits as a chef. He has competed in two 
										student-organized cooking competitions and is currently sitting at 0-2 in his professional record. With each loss, he cultivates his craft and improves upon past failures. 
										One day, he hopes to be a top chef and eventually owner of his own esteemed restaurant in one of the top food cities in America, such as Las Vegas or Charleston, South Carolina.</p>

									<h2>She/Her</h2>
									<p>Margaret is a senior studying Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Electrical Engineering, and she is the Marketing Chair for BSA. In her time at the University, she 
										has been a research assistant for a particle physics lab, a committee member for the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), and a member of the Society of Women 
										Engineers (SWE). Margaret is most proud of the time she spent as Mechanical Lead for a SWE project team. The project was focused on making a wearable which communicates
										 with alarm systems in clean rooms, and alerts people who are hard-of-hearing about any danger.Margaret has previously worked as a Vehicle Systems Intern for General
										  Motors. This summer, she will be working as a Project Engineer Intern for Whiting-Turner Construction, and she is very excited to learn about the construction 
										  business. After graduation, Margaret hopes to either attend graduate school, or work full time as an engineer. Most of all, she wants to apply her engineering education 
										  towards making the world a better place for the less fortunate, and she will work in whatever industry allows her to do so. In her free time, Margaret enjoys watching 
										  TV (in admittedly dangerous amounts), reading murder mystery novels, watching documentaries, and copying webcomics for drawing practice.</p>
